=========== WARNING ===========

The --json flag has recently changed and is now using
a format consistent with Semgrep itself.

If you rely on the old format, please pin your Docker image to:
  returntocorp/semgrep-agent:legacy

This legacy image will keep working until May 2022.

For questions or support, please reach out at https://r2c.dev/slack
