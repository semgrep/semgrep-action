=========== DEPRECATION WARNING ===========

Semgrep's audit mode setting will be removed by 2022 May.

Please update your CI configuration. Your CI script should run this command to ignore findings:
    $ semgrep ci || true

We recommend setting up separate CI jobs for pull request and push events, so that you can ignore findings only on push events.

For questions or support, please reach out at https://r2c.dev/slack
